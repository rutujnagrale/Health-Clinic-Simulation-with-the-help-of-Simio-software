# Health-Clinic-Simulation-with-the-help-of-Simio-software
This is basically a single 25 mb SPFX file which you can run on the simio software, you can download the simio software from there official website https://www.simio.com/   after that you can simply import SPFX file in the software

We present discrete-event simulation models of the operations of Health Clinic in the Indian context. Our simulation models incorporate four types of patients seeking medical care: outpatients, inpatients, childbirth cases, and patientsseeking antenatal care. A generic modeling approach was adopted to develop simulation models of operations. This involved developing an archetype simulation, which was then adapted to represent two other configurations, differing in numbers of resources and types of services provided, encountered during visits.
